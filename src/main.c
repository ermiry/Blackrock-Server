// TODO: have the idea of creating many virtual servers in different sockets?
// or maybe we can create many servers and handle the requests via a load balancer,
// that is only listening on one port?
// TODO: if we want to send a file, maybe create a new TCP socket in a new port?

// 13/10/2018 -- the idea here is to have multiple servers that serve different purposses, for example:
// we can have the game servers that handle the in game multiplayer logic,
// but we can also have a server that can handle other types of requests such as getting files
// maybe all the requests can arrive to the load balancer and depending on the request type and 
// any other paramater that we give it, it can redirect the request to the correct server

// TODO: maybe handle this in a separate list by a name?

    - start the servers
        - tcp servers need to accept connections and handle logic
            - but what if we can make the game server handle different protocols?
